# School_District_Analysis

##Project Overview

A school district requested an analysis of data regarding type of school (charter vs.public), math and reading test scores, and budget data. The majority of the analyses were surface level decriptives. The data was cleaned by removing cases in which there was missing data and checking for duplicates. Summary statistics were reviewed. A count of students by school was completed, mean budgets for the two school types were calculated, and mean math scores(sorted by grade level and school type) were calculated and displayed. 

##Findings 

Minimal findings were caclucalated. In general charter schools had a lowere budget and better mean math scores accross grade levels. However the usefulness of these data are limited as the breakdown of budget to students was not explored and the elimination of several cases with missing data made the results of questional validity.

##Future Analyses

Further analyses could be done on budget per student rather than overall budgets. This should include cases that were otherwise dropped for missing data. Removing them from the count by school type is not valid when considering per student budgets. They could be removed exclusively from the mean calculations of scores instead. Results of test coutcomes by school type and categorical ranges of budget per student could also be created.
